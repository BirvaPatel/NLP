Task: Nonlinear regression w/t DL

Implement a one dimensional convolution (Conv1D)-based neural network for predicting median
house value using longitude, latitude, housing median age, total number of rooms, total number of
bedrooms, population, number of households, and median income. The solution must be a nonlinear
regression model. It must consider the following parameters:
Modular coding, Over/under fitting issue, Vanishing/exploding gradient issue, Number of trainable parameters, Kernel size, Inference time, Train/test split ratio of 70:30.
